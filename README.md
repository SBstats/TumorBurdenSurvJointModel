# TumorBurdenSurvJointModel
This repository contains R code for simulation studies from the paper "Integrating tumor burden with survival outcome for treatment effect evaluation in oncology trials."


## Notes on How to Use the Code

- The R files named `TBproject_Sim1.R` through `TBproject_Sim4.R` contain simulation code for four simulation scenarios. Each execution of one of these files corresponds to a single replicated dataset. To run simulations across multiple datasets (e.g., 1000 replications), these files should be executed in parallel using a unique seed. We performed this step using a supercomputer by submitting a batch job request.

- The output of parallel runs for each simulation scenario is a `.txt` file containing results from 1000 replicated datasets. As a result, for each simulation scenario, there is a corresponding `.txt` file summarizing the outcomes across 1000 replications.

- The R file `ComputeRejectionRates.R` takes the `.txt` files generated by the simulation scripts as input and computes summary statistics, including rejection rates.
